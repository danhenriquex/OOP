# Content

In this discipline I learned advanced concepts about C++ such as:

1. Variables and Constants
2. Array and Vectors
3. Strings
4. Pointers and Reference

# Compiling and Running

I've compiled and executed this software only in Linux (Mint and Ubuntu). These are the steps needed in order to compile the program:

1. Make sure you've all dependencies installed as g++.
2. Download the source code together with the Makefile.
3. Done.

To execute the files, just issue the following command from the project root directory.

    $ ./pdv ./poligonos ./cadastro ./bank
